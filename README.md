# BasicBenchmark
The most basic CPU benchmark you could possibly imagine.

Generates two random numbers and then multiplies them together.
Repeats 100,000,000 times, then reports how long it took.

I used this to gauge relative speeds of desktop CPUs and microprocesors running CircuitPython.

This is not a robust or highly informative benchmark - just guage one very basic dimension that doesn't reflect most real-world usage.
